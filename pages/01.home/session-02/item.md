## Digital Privacy
* What do institutions/companies/websites know about me?
* Why does it matter?

===

## Digital Privacy

Privacy != Secret

Privy --> Privacy

Are you protecting yourself from **harm** or **influence**?

### What does X know about me? (Mapping Activity)
![map of data a bank might know about you](https://github.com/TaylorJadin/dpl2019-data-code-ethics/raw/master/images/photo-2.jpeg)
**x = **
* Bank?
* Employer?
* School?
* Local/State/Federal government?
* Local stores?
* Hospital / Doctor
* Any person on social media / the internet?
* More ideas?

### Ads and Web tracking

* [Who does Google think I am?](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated)
* [AdChoices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/)
* [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com)
  * Visit a few websites, maybe [snc.edu](https://snc.edu), maybe some other schools, businesses etc.

What can be learned from tracking a person's use of the web?

### Why does this stuff matter?

#### Identity theft

* Old problem
* In a digital world this can be done at scale

#### Advertising

* Influencing how you think
* way more prevalant, harder to notice
* "Free" products can be designed to be addictive to show you more ads (more on this later!)
* Political advertising / propaganda?
  * [The Great Hack](https://www.netflix.com/title/80117542)

### What can you do?

* education!
* adblocker?
* delete stuff
* different emails (myemail@gmail.com -> myemail+bestbuy@gmail.com) (disposable email addresses [mailinator.com](https://mailinator.com))
