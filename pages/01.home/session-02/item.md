## Digital Privacy
* What do institutions/companies/websites know about me?
* Why does it matter?

===

## Digital Privacy

### Skepticism, Criticism, Ethical Imagination

Privacy != Secret
Privy --> Privacy

### What does X know about me?
![map of data a bank might know about you](https://github.com/TaylorJadin/dpl2019-data-code-ethics/raw/master/images/photo-2.jpeg)
* Bank?
* Employer?
* School?
* Local/State/Federal government?
* Local stores?


### Ad-tracking
* [Who does Google think I am?](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated)
* [AdChoices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/)
* [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com)
  * Visit a few websites, maybe [snc.edu](https://snc.edu) maybe some other schools, businesses etc.

## Why does this stuff matter?
### Identity theft

* Most obvious
* Age-old problem
* In a digital world can be done at scale
* 
### Advertising
* Influential
* Behavior changing
* "Free" products can be designed to be addictive to show you more ads (more on this later!)
