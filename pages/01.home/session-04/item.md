## History of the Web

### The Internet

* The global computer network. NOT web pages!
* Websites are just one thing that we use the internet for (its by far the most popular thing)

### BBS

* Pre-web service. Connected to from old computer terminals, some still exist today!
* Usually centered around a topic, like a Facebook Group/Page, Subreddit, or Forum

### The Web

![screenshot of the first website](www.png)

* Timeline
  * Tim Berners-Lee invented WWW in 1989
  * First web browser in 1990
  * The browser was released outside CERN in 1991 
  * 1993 - WWW announced free to use, Mosaic web browser came out (first popular browser)
* [The first webpage!](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html)
* [SpaceJam](https://www.spacejam.com/archive/spacejam/movie/jam.htm)
* [WayBack Machine](https://archive.org/web/)

### Why was the web such a big deal?

* Web sites are viewable using Web browsers
* Available to anyone with an internet connection and a computer that can run a web browser, not just the members of a particular BBS
* HTML is easy to read / write
  * Anyone can learn it by looking at other websites
  * Hyper Text Markup Language
    * Hypertext = Links!
    * Markup = kind of like code, but more like a document

### Let's look at some HTML (I promise its not that scary)

* Visit [the first web page](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html)
* Right click on the page and select **View Page Source** (in Chrome)
* Open Notepad (Windows), Textedit(Mac), or the text editor of your choice
* copy and paste the source code from the first web page, into your text editor.
* Open mypage.html
